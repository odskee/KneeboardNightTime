# Intro
Very. very simple tool to make dark "kneeboards" from existing lighter images for games like DCS.

<br />

# How to Use
Naigate to releases (on the right) and download KneeboardNightTime.exe.  Once downloaded, it will process any .png or .jpg images that reside within the same folder as the exe.

Run the program and provide your desired alpha value.  This must be a number between 0 and 255 inclusive.  Optionally, you can specify the text to appended to the darkened image - it defaults to "Dark" if not provided.

<br />

# Example
If you have 5 images in C:\My_Images\ that you want to darken, copy the KneeboardNightTime.exe to this location.  Run the exe.  You now have 10 files, 5 original and 5 darkened.
